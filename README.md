# Keeper – React Learning Project 🧠⚛️

This project is part of my **React learning journey**.

I am building a simple Google Keep–like notes app step by step,
implementing new features **only after learning the corresponding React concepts**.

The goal is not to finish fast, but to deeply understand React
by applying each concept in a real project.

---

## ✅ Concepts Implemented So Far
- React project setup (Vite)
- Component-based architecture
- Props
- Mapping data using `.map()`
- Arrow functions
- Basic folder structure

---

## 🧪 Current State
- Static notes rendered from data
- No state or interactivity yet (intentional)
- Project will evolve as I learn more React concepts

---

## 🛠️ Planned (as I learn React)
- `useState`
- Controlled inputs (forms)
- Add new notes
- Delete notes
- Conditional rendering
- Basic UI improvements

---

## 📌 Note
This repository is **not a finished product**.
It is a learning-in-public repository that will be updated regularly
as I progress through React.
